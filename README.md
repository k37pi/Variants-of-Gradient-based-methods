The code files are organised as follows:
1. **functions.py** contains the code for the functions that we will be tetsting the methods on. 
2. **dms.py** conatins the code for the methods themselves. 
3. **apply.py** uses the other 2 files to run the methods on the functions and genertes the 2d and 3d plots.
